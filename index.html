    </section>
    <section id="bio">
        <p> My favorite character is Lincoln Loud from the Nickelodeon show "The Loud House". Lincoln is the only boy in is huge family and talks about the struggles and the activities him and his family does. I like Lincoln because him and his family are comedic and are fun to watch. He is almost my age as is kind of relatable. When I'm bored, I like to watch this show and many others.</p>
